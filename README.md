### Downloading project ### 

The first step to run the application is to clone/download the project from the public repository, which is available online here:  
https://github.com/Matt1s/BP-public
### Installing Node.js ###

In order to download dependencies that are needed for implementation functioning, it is required to install Node.js (preferably version 18.12.1), so that we will be able to use the command "npm" (Node package manager).

Installers are free to download and install here: 
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.12.1. Please make sure that you download the proper installer for your operating system. 

For further Node.js documentation you can visit the official 
Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en

### Starting the backend ###

To start Node.js server, open the command prompt in the project directory - for example,
``` "D:/downloads/BP-public" ```
and type in 
```  npm install ```

Node package manager will now install dependencies, after that, please run 

``` node ./server/server.js ```

You will be informed on which host and port server is listening to.

### Starting the frontend ###

In order to run frontend code, just open the index.html file and follow the user scenario, which is defined in either Appendix C - usability test report or Appendix D - technical documentation.
